SubVT (Substrate Validator Toolkit - former Subvalt) is a native mobile application for iOS and Android phones, tablets and wearables that provides node operators with tools that aid them in running their validators on any Substrate-based blockchain network. Please visit the SubVT top-level [repository](https://github.com/helikon-labs/subvt) for documentation and other links and information.

This is the repository for the complete SubVT backend services:

- Network status live data server.
- Active and inactive validator lists and details server.
- Era and validator reports server.
- Block processor.
- Push, email, SMS and GSM notification services.

SubVT is in heavy progress, and this repository is subject to frequent change.
